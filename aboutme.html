<h2>Demonstrating the Box Model</h2>

<p> I'm a first time coder. This is something that I've wanted to try for a while but didn't know how to .So i decided to sign up for this program and then BAM! I was accepted in it.</p>                                                                                         

<div>This text is the actual content of the box. We have added a 25px padding, 25px margin and a 25px green border.
